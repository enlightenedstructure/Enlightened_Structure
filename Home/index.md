Enlightened Structure
=====================

What problem does this project address?
  : A key issue with the architecture of the emergent trust landscape of the internet is silos of non-interoperable trust information, making it difficult for users to coalesce a cogent trust landscape.
  : Furthermore, current collaboration paradigms are limited â€“ notably, it is difficult to collaborate with large numbers of people, especially when conflicting ideas are present.

What is the goal of this project?
  : The goal of Enlightened Structure is to enable and facilitate the emergence of a simple and powerful open platform for humanity to exchange its trust information, amalgamating existing trust ratings from many sources, feeding them into a free, open, globally distributed information network and API.
  : We work from first principles, focussing on both human and machine readability. Everything is content addressable, built on node graphs, and designed for next-generation in-browser 2D & 3D visualization and navigation.

What is the scope of this project?
  : The scope is creating the underlying frameworks that will enable those technologies to emerge. We have published APIs (in open collaborative forkable form) for trust networks and creative collaboration, and are delivering candidate components to fulfill the promise of those APIs.

What development methodology is being used?
  : We are fully immersed in open source collaboration ethos, using existing systems such as github, and bootstrapping on our own collaboration engine, creating our IP inside of the systems we are devloping.

NodeMap
-------

Key/value storage for arbitrary blobs of binary or text data.

NodeSentences
-------------

Storage for subject/predicate/object triples -- or any other chain of nodes.

ForkDiffMerge
-------------

A vision for a large-scale parallel creative collaboration engine, a self-evolving container for
collective intelligence to congregate around a project, while retaining the edits and contributions
of every individual throughout the history of the collaboration. &nbsp; [read more

WikiNodes
---------

Rich node network data visualization layer.

NodeNav
-------

Visual navigation of information, eventually in virtual reality.  For example, Adam Apollo's [Core
Network][], a visual interface based on the geometry and physics of space-time.

The Trust Exchange
------------------

A vision for a simple and powerful open platform for humanity to exchange its trust information, the
Trust Exchange will amalgamate existing ratings from any source, feeding them into a free, open,
globally distributed information network and API. &nbsp; [read more &raquo;](/Trust_Exchange)

BaseParadigm
------------

All data in the Enlightened Structure stack is stored as graph edge documents, implemented on top
of a content addressable object store. Links between documents are themselves edge documents.

Enlightened Structure Web Services APIs
---------------------------------------

The Enlightened Structure technology stack is being implemented as a set of RESTful web services
APIs. *This is a work in progress, and these APIs are prone to change before their official
release.* &nbsp; [read more &raquo;](/API)
