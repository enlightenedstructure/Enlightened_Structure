--------------------------------------------

Create duplication freely - clone and duplicate things. The tools will handle merging, seeing
things that are the same across the network or with trunks (chunks?) of sameness within the same
network.

Think of knowledge nodes in a flat namespace? If Jack has a bunch of knowledge nodes nested, they
should all be stored in a flat namespace like wikis. This is super important for the tools for
merging and diffing, etc.
