This is a living roadmap.  In general, the targets closer to "now" are more stable than the later targets, which are more likely to change as new information and opportunities emerge and are incorporated.  

Q2 2012
-------

- Allow cloning (forking) and remixing websites in the creative commons, as a collection of pages

- Publish this collection to an appropriate subdomain, e.g. your-project.your-name.softwarezero.cc

- Other users can clone (fork) your collections, and curate them independently

- Merge all or part of the changes from another user's version of a given collection back into your version

Q3 2012
-------

- Visually discover trending and relevant remixes of content, based on popularity and trust metrics

- Merge changes made in federated wikis back into existing authoring tools (starting with Wordpress)

Q4 2012
-------

- Rate authors and content, resulting in a rich network of trust information

2013
----

- Compare two versions of a page to easily to see changes and additions
- "Node Collectives" allow the creation of distributed ownership of information on a given topic, serving up the items of the greatest interest to the individual visitor
