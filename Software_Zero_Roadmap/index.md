title: "Software Zero ::: Roadmap"

This is a living roadmap.  In general, the targets closer to "now" are more stable than the later targets, which are more likely to change as new information and opportunities emerge and are incorporated.  

The versions that we release, even in alpha and beta, must be compelling: people want to use it, and keep coming back.


Spring 2012: Open Your Project
------------------------------

* Crawl creative commons licensed websites and clone the content into editable wiki instances.  Each curator can edit independently, and merge in the edits they like from other curators' versions. 
* Each content collection is a [Smallest Federated Wiki][] (SFW) instance -- a new kind of wiki from Ward Cunningham, inventor of the original wiki, designed from the ground up for global-scale collaboration around rich content.  SFW supports simple dragging and dropping of text, images, and data *between SFW instnaces*, even those running on different servers.  

Summer 2012
-----------

- Allow cloning (forking) and remixing websites in the creative commons, as a collection of pages

- Publish this collection to an appropriate subdomain, e.g. your-project.your-name.commons.cc

- Other users can clone (fork) your collections, and curate them independently

- Merge all or part of the changes from another user's version of a given collection back into your version

- Forking can happen in two ways: 
  - Authors can drop a JavaScript snippet into their site, which creates a "Remix" button on their page
  - Content curators can directly clone (fork) sites in the creative commons, through command line tools, website, and/or browser plugin

Fall 2012
---------

- Visually explore and navigate content collections through radial node network interfaces

- Merge changes made in federated wikis back into existing authoring tools (starting with Wordpress)

Winter 2012
-----------

- Information in the data visualization is informed by users' trust ratings of authors and content.

- Visualize and explore the node collection that is the intersection between this node collective (eg “nanotechdesertsolar”) and the viewer's trust network

- Visually discover trending and relevant remixes of content, based on popularity and trust metrics

2013
----

- Compare two versions of a page to easily to see changes and additions

- Merging is an interactive process that happens on the client side, in the diff tool

- "Node Collectives" allow the creation of distributed ownership of information on a given topic, serving up the items of the greatest interest to the individual visitor
