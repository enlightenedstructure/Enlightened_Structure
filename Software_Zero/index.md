Software Zero is the enlightened tech platform in which to crowdsource all the other enlightened tech platform

Is a foundation for the full systems.  We have in mind the full-blown vision, and we want to do steps towards that.

Is good enough that people want to use it, and keep coming back.

All of the service components talk to each other 

Assumptions
===========
Publishing
  : People publish their websites however they choose, eg Wordpress, Jekyll, wikis, etc.

NodeCollective
==============
User can register (eg) nanotechdesertsolar.com as a NodeCollective -- 
which in turn allows users to register nanotechdesertsolar.myname.com as a nanotechdesertsolar fork.  
The parent collective has datavis / datanav of the viewer's trust networks' flowerings of relevant nodes.

Dataviz / Datanav
-----------------
  * View the node collection that is the intersection between this node collective (eg “nanotechdesertsolar”) and the viewer's trust network. 
  * Navigate the node collection and related nodes.
  * Full screen / zoom into the content of a given node
  * One node is central.  
  * Radial node/edge interface

Trust Filters
-------------
User trust ratings of nodes (primarily including authors and content)
Basic trust cone algorithms to apply the trust information in a meaningful way

Remixing
========
Authors can drop in JavaScript snippet to make a fork button on their page, and show other available forks (through NodeCollective)

MergeChanges
============
Users submits documents to compare, and a diff is displayed.

Merging is an interactive process that happens on the client side, in the diff tool. The resulting document can be saved to the node store.

BaseParadigm
============
At a low level, everything rests on node stores and graph edges.
